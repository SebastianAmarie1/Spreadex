Train Of Thought:
I firstly noticed which shapes share which attributes. For example every shape share the 
variables X and Y.
Next I noticed that all shapes must have a print function to print out their features.
I had to also ensure that the values were positive as you are unable to have negative sizes, diameters, ect.
X and Y can be negative due to the fact that they are co-ordinates.


Design Decisions:
Printing.cs:
This is a interface that will be used to print the details of each shape.

Shape.cs:
This will store all the details that are shared acrross all shapes such as X and Y.
A function will also print the co-ordinates

/Shapes:
This will classes for all the shapes that are needed with the attributes needed.
This will also contain a print statement that will display the attributes of the individual shape.

DrawingApplication.cs:
This will be used to create the shapes and print the details
